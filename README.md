# BlOG / XYZ - fullstack project

## Tech Stack
**Front-End** - React.js, CSS, HTML

**Back-End** - Node.js, Express.js. MongoDB,

**Deploy** - Github-page (frontend), Heroku (backend), MongoDB Atlas (database)

**Dependencies** - axios, multer, bcrypt, cors, dotenv, mongoose

## Motivation
* I want to build a project from scratch. From desgining database schemas, APIs to handle http error handling and frontend pages. I want to have a full grasp of how a website actually works. 
* As an engineer, I know sooner or later I will encounter bugs from everywhere, why not now.

## Challenges
* Designing APIs, manage different routers and endpoints inside Express.
* Designing database schemas, building a server that connects to mongoDB Atlas.
* Opening frontend and backend editors at the same time. It's really hard to keep work flow organized.
* Wasting time on minor mistakes like typos.
* Learn how Heroku works.
* Adding mini-interactions to frontend 
* Uploading files inside form element, use multer to store files inside diskstorage.
* Using local Storage to store user info.
* Fixing bugs when connecting mongoDB Atlas with Heroku.

## Features
* User Login / Registration

* Password Encyption

* Edit/Delete Posts

* Update UserInfo
 
* Fetch Posts of a User / Category

* Responsive Website

* Write/Delete/Update Post



## Takeaways
* When developing, set mongodb **Network Access** to your IP address, when deploying, set it to anywhere or your server IP address.
* I probably should develop the backend first, then the frontend. Hard coding the frontend wasted a lot of time. 
* Always draw out the structure of products first before starting to develop it. 
* Encrypt sensitive information is very important, I used **bcrypt** this time, next time use JWT.
* While waiting for data fetching, frontend should display a **pending status** to indicate the 
* More familiar with HTTP status code.
* Learned how to deploy projects to Heroku.
